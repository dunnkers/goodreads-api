# goodreads-api ‚ú®

Tiny ruby server that exposes your Goodreads shelves with proper cover images. This is useful when creating a digital shelf for example.

## Requirements

- Ruby
- Redis

## Usage

Configure two environment variables:

```shell
export GOODREADS_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
export GOODREADS_USER_ID=<your_user_id>
```
Get an api key [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys). User id is visible in your profile link.

Install dependencies:

```shell
bundle install
```

(make sure Gemfile and system Ruby versions match)

To start the Sinatra server:

```shell
ruby app.rb
```

Visit [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)! üíé

To force re-grabbing the cover images:

```shell
rake fetch
```

Make sure Redis is running.

## Architecture

Links to cover images are found by crawling each book Goodreads page and processing it with nokogiri. These links are then stored in a Redis db and are then retrieved again by the server.
