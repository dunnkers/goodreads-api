# goodreads-api ‚ú®

Tiny ruby server that exposes your Goodreads shelves with proper cover images. This is useful when creating a digital shelf for example.

Digital shelf. This server can be used as an API for your digital [reading shelf frontend](https://github.com/dunnkers/dunnkers.github.io/tree/reading-shelf).

## Requirements

- Ruby
- Redis

## Usage

1. Configure two environment variables:

```shell
export GOODREADS_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
export GOODREADS_USER_ID=<your_user_id>
```
Get an api key [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys). User id is visible in your profile link.

2. Install dependencies:

```shell
bundle install
```

(make sure Gemfile and system Ruby versions match)

3. Run redis
Make sure Redis is running.

e.g. MacOS:
```shell
brew install redis
redis-server
```

4. Start the Sinatra server:

```shell
ruby app.rb
```

Visit [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/) üíé

To force re-grabbing the cover images:

```shell
rake fetch
```

## Architecture

Links to cover images are found by crawling each book Goodreads page and processing it with nokogiri. These links are then stored in a Redis db and are then retrieved again by the server.

### Development
To debug, use the VSCode Ruby extension to configure a `launch.json` file in `/.vscode`. Make sure to add the environment variables to your configuration:

```json
"configurations": [
    {
        ...
        "env": {
            "GOODREADS_API_KEY": "<your_api_key>",
            "GOODREADS_USER_ID": "<your_user_id>"
        }
    }
]
```

Set `launch.json` to execute `app.rb` to debug the server, or `fetch-shelves.rb` to debug the functions. To debug `fetch-shelves.rb`, add a line at the end of the file, executing one of the functions.

## Deployment

You can deploy easily on any platform desired - just setup a Ruby environment and make sure a Redis instance is running in the network. Its connection parameters are at default. Also make sure to set the environment variables. Feel free to build a Dockerfile with the required setup.

Out of the box, however, Heroku deployment works well. Just launch an app with the heroku/ruby buildpack, and install the Heroku Redis add-on. You can use Heroku Scheduler to periodically fetch new data; configure the job to execute `rake fetch`. Cheers!
